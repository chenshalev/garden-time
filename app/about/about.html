        <p>Garden maintenance is a complex task that depends on different parameters. From the weather, plants suitable for the region, planting and fertilization regime, and the human factors that treat it. In a private home garden, installing a computerized
            watering system will not solve all maintenance and maintenance problems since it will operate mostly during the summer months. During the transitional seasons, and even in the winter, there may be dry weeks and busy garden owners are not always
            awake for additional watering. In addition, there are sometimes areas without a system, such as: potted plants, seasonal vegetable garden and more. Beyond the need to schedule the watering and determine the appropriate amount for each type
            and size of plant and wood, there are additional annual needs to remember to perform on time: fertilization, pruning, picking, planting and sowing. The immediate concern is that the caregiver in the garden will forget to perform these tasks,
            but in addition, there is not always a single caregiver in the garden and if there are other figures caring for the garden, whether some of the residents or an outside professional, there is a fear of duplication in the treatments.

        <p>This awsome app will provide alerts and collect information from caregivers in the garden. By connecting to the Weather app and synchronizing with the calendar, you can enter tasks and alerts. The caregivers in the garden will be required to report
            on the types of treatments done in the application, so that the owner of the garden can follow and intervene if necessary.
